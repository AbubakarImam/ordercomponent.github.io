### What I learned

I learned more about using an svg as background image and making it repeat based on my liking

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

I will like to apply this on my e-commerce website i developed in future, where a user can check the product to confirm before procedding to payment
